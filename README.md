Creative coding major project_Functioning prototype

## Choose to use the level or frequency content of an audio track to animate the work
Firstly, I reconstructed the conceptual framework of this image design by changing and adding new elements to the group's code images, adding more possibilities and design concepts to the original design concept of "Wheels of Fortune". For example, constantly rotating and moving circles will always converge into another circular image at a certain moment, just like the "cycle" in the original concept, where each cycle will continue to change, but eventually it will still move towards a normal track. The images below are raw images of the team's work.

In terms of selecting sound clips, I chose the "Fate Symphony" arranged by Beethoven, which is consistent with the image style and design concept of this project. The rhythm and sound curve of this piece have the characteristic of ups and downs, which can create more visual changes.

## Change the original group task image
In this section, I mainly made some changes to the original colors in the group code, such as adjusting the background color to a random Moranti color scheme, to create a higher sense of motion for the new image. In terms of functional setting changes, the main focus is to change the original dot background to a fan-shaped shape, and to change the ellipses (x, y) of those large circles to ellipses (0,0), and then use translate to control their positions. As shown in the image below, the fan-shaped shape changes with the frequency of the sound.
