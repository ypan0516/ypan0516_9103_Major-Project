## Choose to use the level or frequency content of an audio track to animate the work
Firstly, I reconstructed the conceptual framework of this image design by changing and adding new elements to the group's code images, adding more possibilities and design concepts to the original design concept of "Wheels of Fortune". For example, constantly rotating and breaking down the reassembled dots will always converge into another circular image at a certain moment, just like the "cycle" in the original concept, where each cycle will continue to change, but eventually it will still move towards a normal track. The images below are raw images of the team's work.

In terms of selecting sound clips, I chose the "Fate Symphony" arranged by Beethoven, which is consistent with the image style and design concept of this project. The rhythm and sound curve of this piece have the characteristic of ups and downs, which can create more visual changes.
